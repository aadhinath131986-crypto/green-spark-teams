## üîí Security Requirements

**Critical Rules:**
1. **Role-based access:** Never store roles in profiles table - use separate user_roles table
2. **RLS policies:** All tables must have RLS enabled
3. **Input validation:** Use Zod schemas for all form inputs
4. **Image validation:** Check file size and type before upload
5. **Admin verification:** Always verify admin role server-side using has_role() function
6. **Signed URLs:** Use signed URLs for private storage buckets
7. **SQL injection prevention:** Never use raw SQL - use Supabase client methods
8. **Authentication checks:** Require auth.uid() in RLS policies for user-specific data

---

## üì± Responsive Design

**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

**Mobile Considerations:**
- Stack hero CTAs vertically
- Single column activity grid
- Collapsible navigation
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Optimized image sizes

---

## üé≠ User Experience

**Loading States:**
- Spinners for async operations
- Skeleton screens for data fetching
- Disabled buttons during submission

**Toast Notifications:**
- Success: Green theme
- Error: Red theme
- Info: Blue theme
- Position: Top-right
- Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds

**Animations:**
- Hover scale on cards (1.02x)
- Smooth transitions (300ms)

- Gradient animations

**Error Handling:**
- Friendly error messages
- Validation feedback
- Network error recovery
- Graceful fallbacks
